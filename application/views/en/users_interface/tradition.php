							The ancient history of Tsimlyansk winemaking dates back to the legendary times of Khazar Khanate,

							construction of the Reservoir, residents of the Khazar fortress Sarkel, a site now submerged, 
							cultivated grapes and made wines.

							Once Prince Svyatoslav conquered the fortress and it was subsequently destroyed in the Cuman invasion, 
							winemaking in the Don region was under threat but the vineyards survived and the Cossacks continued the 
							fine tradition.

							The first explicit record of Tsimlyansky wine is attributed to Peter the Great, who after visiting a

							troops as a gift.

							The Russian emperor was a connoisseur of Tsimlyansky wines, making various efforts 
							to support production development. He even planted five grape plants himself in the

					<h2>The Cossacks Sparkling Wine</h2>

							In the 18th century the Cossacks invented their own sparkling wines technology.
							The first documented bottle of Tsimlyansk Sparkling Wine is dated 1786.  
							It has always been produced from the indigenous grape varieties Tsimlyansky Black and Plechistik. 
							Once harvested the grapes were left to dry on reed mats in a well ventilated area. The slightly dried 
							grapes were then crushed, pressed and mixed with juice in special containers named podrez.
						</p>
						<p>
							During fermentation the mash was not stirred and so skins floated up to the surface while seeds sank 
							to the bottom. Due to high sugar levels fermentation was slow and halted by the time cold weather arrived 
							in late autumn. In the spring wine was bottled. Cork was tied with strings to the bottleneck and then 
							sealed with tar. Fermentation resumed within a bottle and accumulation of carbon dioxide inside made the 
							wine sparkling.
